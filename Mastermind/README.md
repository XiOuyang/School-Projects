This program implements the game, 'Mastermind'.

Rules: The player is presented with a 4 digit random number greater than 999
		but less than 10000.
       The player has to guess the correct 4 digit number.
	   She gets 10 chances. 
			If she enters an invalid character, the number is revealed. 
			If she enters the correct number, it is revealed and she wins.

			counter is displayed, telling her how many digits were correct but in 
			the wrong order.

			were off, a 'correct' counter is displayed, telling her how many digits
			were correct and in the right place.
