The end goal of this program is to be able to play the playing card game,
"Deuces", with either another person or a computer. 

The rules of the game are as follows:
	-each player starts with 13 cards
	-turn based game; player with lowest card goes first
	-objective: to get rid of cards in hand before opponent
	-Lowest to highest: 3 to A, then 2 is highest
	-suits from lowest to highest: spades to hearts 
	-cards can be played in doubles, triples, or straights
	(as long as there are 3 cards or greater in consecutive order)
	-if player B cannot 'beat' player A's card(s) with a higher one,
	 she goes again
	
	'Bombs', or 'chops':
	-At least 3 consecutive card pairs, 4 of a kind
	-Only item that can beat 2s
	-Higher Bombs can beat lower ones 

So far, the program generates a 52 card deck, sorts them, and prints out
both the unsorted and sorted version. It then prints out a player's 13 card
hand. More to come!
